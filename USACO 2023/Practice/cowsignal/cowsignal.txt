Bessie and her cow friends are playing as their favorite cow superheroes. Of course, everyone knows that any self-respecting superhero needs a signal to call them to action. Bessie has drawn a special signal on a sheet of M×N paper (1≤M≤10,1≤N≤10), but this is too small, much too small! Bessie wants to amplify the signal so it is exactly K times bigger (1≤K≤10) in each direction.

The signal will consist only of the '.' and 'X' characters.

INPUT FORMAT (file cowsignal.in):
The first line of input contains M
, N, and K, separated by spaces.

The next M
lines each contain a length-N
string, collectively describing the picture of the signal.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file cowsignal.out):
You should output KM
lines, each with KN
characters, giving a picture of the enlarged signal.

SAMPLE INPUT:

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
